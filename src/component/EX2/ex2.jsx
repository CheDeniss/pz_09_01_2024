King graduated from the University of Maine in 1970 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in English. While writing short stories, he supported himself by teaching and working as a janitor, among other jobs. His first published novel, Carrie, about a tormented teenage girl gifted with telekinetic powers, appeared in 1974 (films 1976 and 2013) and was an immediate popular success."/>
